# ğŸŒ¿ Lens Share Extension

## Working:

1. The content script `inject.ts` injects `lens-share-react-app` into the Twitter webpage
2. `lens-share-react-app` is added to the DOM. Easier to handle state, use chakra-ui and other web3 npm packages
3. The "Share on Lens" button is injected into Twitter's code via React Portals
